# l -> locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
# r -> release, will trigger on release of a key.
# e -> repeat, will repeat when held.
# n -> non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
# m -> mouse, see below.
# t -> transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
# i -> ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
# s -> separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](#keysym-combos) above.
# d -> has description, will allow you to write a description for your bind.
