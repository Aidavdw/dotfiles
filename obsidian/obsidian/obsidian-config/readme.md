This folder contains the settings I use for obsidian that I want to share across multiple vaults.

# Synced

-   workspaces.json contains saved layouts from the workspaces plugin.

# Not synced

Files that are not synced are:

-   graph.json, so that the graph filter state is not shared (e.g. by tag)
-   workspace.json and workspace-mobile.json (contains the layout as it last was, when closing. Contains open notes, so
    might make things bad.)
